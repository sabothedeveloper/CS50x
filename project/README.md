# Cookie Clicker Clone

#### Video Demo: [https://clipchamp.com/watch/NOT8tclcYDc]

#### Description:
This project is a clone of the popular game Cookie Clicker. The goal of the game is to click on a cookie to earn points and purchase upgrades to increase the score.

The Cookie Clicker Clone is a simple and addictive web-based game that replicates the core mechanics of the original Cookie Clicker game. Players can click on a large cookie displayed on the screen to earn points. Each click increases the score by a certain amount, determined by the click power.

To enhance gameplay and maximize score accumulation, the game offers upgrades that can be purchased using the earned points. Two types of upgrades are available: click upgrades and idle upgrades. Click upgrades increase the click power, allowing players to earn more points with each click. Idle upgrades introduce automatic score generation when the player is idle, providing a continuous increase in points even when not actively clicking.

The game interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing. The main cookie element is animated with a zoom effect and enlargement animation when clicked, providing satisfying feedback to the player. Additionally, falling cookies animation is constantly displayed on the screen, with the number of falling cookies dynamically changing based on the current score. This visual representation adds a delightful touch and reinforces the sense of progress as more cookies are earned.

The project includes an index.html file that defines the structure of the webpage, a styles.css file for styling the elements, and a script.js file that contains the game logic and handles the interactions.
